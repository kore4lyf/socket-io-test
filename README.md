# Socket.IO Test Project

This repository demonstrates basic real-time communication using [Socket.IO](https://socket.io/). It contains two different implementations to showcase integration with different front-end technologies:

- **Vanilla HTML + Node.js (Socket.IO)**
- **React + Node.js (Socket.IO)**

Each example includes a simple server and client setup to demonstrate real-time messaging using WebSockets via Socket.IO.

## 🔧 Installation

Each project folder is self-contained. To run either, navigate to the folder and follow the instructions below.

### 1. HTML + Node.js + Socket.IO

```bash
cd html-node-socketio
npm install
node index.js
```

Visit: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### 2. React + Node.js + Socket.IO

```bash
cd react-node-socketio
npm install

npm install
npm run build
cd ..
node index.js
```

Visit: [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)

> Note: Make sure to build the React app before running the server.
